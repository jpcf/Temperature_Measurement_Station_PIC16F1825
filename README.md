## Temperature Measurement Station


Electronic Systems class Final Project. Consists of a Temperature/HeartRate monitor based on the PIC16F1825 uController. It uses a Nokia5110 LCD matrix as a means to display.

On the `include` folder, you can find a library that interfaces the display (` `) and another for the 1-Wire Temperature Sensor (` `). We also included a library that performs memory tests on all three memory types: RAM, ROM and EEPROM (` `).

You are free to use this code in your projects, but **please refer the authors**, *Jos√© Fonseca* (me) and *Carlos Ferreira*, from the University of Porto, Portugal.
