## Temperature Measurement Station


Electronic Systems class Final Project. Consists of a Temperature/HeartRate monitor based on the PIC16F1825 uController. It uses a Nokia5110 LCD matrix as a means to display.

On the `include` folder, you can find a library that interfaces the display (`lib_LCD_Nokia5110`) and another for the 1-Wire Temperature Sensor (`ds18b20`). We also included a library that performs memory tests on all three memory types: RAM, ROM and EEPROM (` lib_memtest_PIC16F1825`).

You are free to use this code in your projects, but **please refer the authors**, *Jos√© Fonseca* (me) and *Carlos Ferreira*, from the **University of Porto, Portugal**.
